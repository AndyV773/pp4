### Navigation

The naviagtional menu was used from [W3S Sidenav](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_sidenav_full). It slides in from the right and displays content for both authorized and unauthorized users. It also adjusts to the screen size, covering the full screen on small devices and 67% on large devices, ensuring the channel list remains visible. Additionally, it includes copyright information with a dynamically updated date

- Authorised user navigation menu content includes
  - Account
  - Profile
  - About
  - Contact
  - Request Channel
  - Logout

- Authorised access on large devices

![authorised user navigation on large device](static/images/readme/features/nav/nav-login-d.jpg)

![unauthorised user navigation on small device](static/images/readme/features/nav/nav-logout-m.jpg)

### About

The about page consists of a image, title and content that can be added from the admin panel. It also displays the date it was updated and includes a button linking to the contact page

![about page](static/images/readme/features/about/about-d.jpg)

### Contact

The user can send a contact request to the admin via the contact form. They must include a name, valid email, and message. If the user is authorised, the name and email fields will be autofilled with their data

- Unauthorised user

![contact form](static/images/readme/features/contact/contact-form.jpg)

- Authorised user

![autofilled contact form](static/images/readme/features/contact/contact-form-filled.jpg)

### Request Channel

If the user is authorized, they can submit a channel request to be approved by the admin. The goal is to only allow approved cryptocurrency channels that are listed on CoinGecko. A future feature will handle this via the CoinGecko API, but for now, it is managed through the admin panel. The user can only request channels that do not already exist. A validation error will be thrown if the same channel is requested twice, regardless of case (for example, "Bitcoin" or "bitcoin")

- Approved channel message

![approved channel](static/images/readme/features/add-channel/add-channel-approved.jpg)

- Rejected channel message

![rejected channel](static/images/readme/features/add-channel/add-channel-error.jpg)

## Requirements

### Tools
- **Gunicorn** Python HTTP server for WSGI applications
- **Whitenoise** for serving of static files
- **Cloudinary** cloud storage for images

### Libraries
- **Psycopg2** Python PostgreSQL database adapter
- **Django Allauth** registration authentication managment
- **Django Crispy forms** super easy serving of crispy forms
- **Django Summernote** for rich text editing in admin panel
- **Django Countries** provides country choices for use with forms


## Deployment
This project was deployed using Heroku

**PostgreSQL**

This project uses PostgreSQL database provided by Code Institue

**Cloudinary API**

This project uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for storing media files

### Heroku Deployment

Fork or clone this [repository](https://github.com/AndyV773/pp4)

Heroku requires 3 additional files for deployment
- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

Ensure Procfile is added with the correct command to run gunicorn: 

`web: gunicorn cryptonet.wsgi`

- You can create a new Procile with the following command:

`echo web: gunicorn <app_name>.wsgi > Procfile`

- Replace <app_name> with the primary Django app name that locates settings.py

Ensure runtime.txt has the correct Python version:

`python-3.12`

- You can check Python version by running either command:

`python -V`

`python --version`

**Create a new app in Heroku**

- Click "New" in the Heroku dashboard and select "Create new app" from the drop down menu
- Add an app name (must be unique) and select your closest region (United States or Europe), then click "Create app"
- Navigate to the Settings tab within the new app, locate and click "Reveal Config Vars". Set the key and values. Here is an example:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| DATABASE_URL | <your_database_url> |
| SECRET_KEY | <your_secret_key> |
| CLOUDINARY_URL | cloudinary://<your_api_key>:<your_api_secret>@dpwhdmvce |
| DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 (Can be used to temporary disable collection of static files) |

Once this is done, navigate to the "deploy" tab:

- Link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
- Click on **Deploy Branch** in "Manual deploy" section

Alternatively, you can enable automatic deployments with every push to the repository by clicking "Enable Automatic Deploy" in the "Automatic Deploy" section

### Local Deployment

- Fork or clone this [repository](https://github.com/AndyV773/pp4)

- Install all requirements by running the following command in the terminal:

` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `

If you have your own packages or have installed other requirements, then you can updated the requirements.txt with the command:

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

- Set Environment Varibles, here is an example [.env.example](https://github.com/AndyV773/pp4/blob/main/.env.example)

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
